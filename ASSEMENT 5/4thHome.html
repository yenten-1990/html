<h3><center>Knowing Our School<strong></strong></center></h3>
<p>The place where the present school stands was known as “Dashiding which means “a valley/basin of prayer flags”. According to the folks of the community, the place was widely used for erecting different prayer flags. Thus, the wind over the hill of Dashiding carried the message of prayer flags across the hills and valleys.  The lush green meadow beneath the thick chirpine vegetation also nourished the local people as their grazing land.</p>

<p>The school and parents valued this historical significance and unanimously resolved to name the school as “Dashiding” to honour the age old tradition and spiritual sanctity associated to the place and its name.</p><br><br>
        
<h3><center><strong>Brief History</strong></center></h3>

<p>Dashiding Higher Secondary School is situated on the brow of a sub- temperate hill above the Mitsina town in Barp Gewog of PunakhaDzongkhag. It is two kilometres uphill drive from the highway which diverges at a junction at about 200 metres before reaching the Mitsina town from Thimphu. The school strategically towers above the human settlements, overlooking the valleys and the Punatsangchu River.</p><br><br>

<h3><center><strong>Establishment</strong></center></h3>

<p>Dashiding started as a middle secondary school with assistance from the World Bank. The school was consecrated on 8th May, 2010 by His Eminence, Gyalwa Shacha Rimpoche, the successive reincarnation of Je Gyalwa Sacha Rinchen and Rechung Dorji Drakpa, the enlightened disciple of Great Jetsuen Milarepa. His Excellency, Lyonpo Thakur Singh Powdyel, the then Education Minister inaugurated the school on the same day. The consecration and inauguration ceremony was attended by Mr. Mark La Prairie,the Representative of World Bank, Dasho Dzongda and officials from Punakha, BBS, parents, students and staff. The school marks its Foundation Day on 8th May as an annual event.</p>

<p>The school was upgraded to higher secondary school in 2014 with additional buildings constructed through the GOI’s financial assistance.</p><br><br>
