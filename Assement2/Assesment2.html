        <h3> paro</h3>
        <p>Accentuating the natural beauty are the elegant, traditional-style houses that dot the valley and surrounding hills. One of the distinctive features of Paro town is that it is situated in a flat valley bottom and follows a grid-like pattern. The central plaza is adorned with a large prayer wheel and a small amphitheater where events are held throughout the year.

There are over 155 temples and monasteries in the area, some dating as far back as the 14th century. The country’s first and only international airport is also located in the region. Its close proximity to the historical and religious sites in the region has resulted in the development of an array of luxurious, high-end tourist resorts making Paro one of the main destination for visitors.</p>

    <h2>GNH</h2>
        <P>Economists all over the world have argued that the key to happiness is obtaining and..enjoying... material development..Bhutan however, adheres to a very different belief and.advocates that... amassing material wealth does not necessarily lead to happiness. Bhutan is.now trying to.measure... progress not by the popular idea of Gross Domestic Product but through Gross National... Happiness.
While conventional development models stressed on economic growth as the ultimate.objective,... the.concept of Gross National Happiness is based on the premise that true development of human... society takes place when material and spiritual development occur side by side to complement and... reinforce each other.

..While the emphasis is placed on both,.prosperity
..and happiness, the latter is considered to be... ..more significant. Thus, Gross National... ..Happiness is now being fleshed out by a wide... ..range of professionals, scholars and agencies... ..across the world.

..The philosophy of Gross National Happiness has recently received international ..recognition and the UN has implemented a resolution “recognizing that the ..gross domestic product does not adequately reflect the happiness and well-  ..being of people”, and that “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human ..goal”.  </P>
