    <strong>Pema Lingpa</strong> (pad+ma gling pa) was born in Chel <strike>Baridrang</strike> (chal ba ri brang), in the Tang (stangs) valley in the district of Bumtang (bum thang). His father was Dondrub Zangpo (don grub bzang po, d.u.) of Sumtrang (sum phrang) and his mother was Pema Dronma (pad+ma sgron ma, d.u.). His birth was on the <em>fifteenth day</em> of the second month of the male iron-horse year of the eighth sexagenary cycle, corresponding to<sup>1450</sup>.<br>His parents named him Dondrub Gyelpo (don grub rgyal po) and his maternal aunt Peldron (dpal sgron) named him Peljor (dpal 'byor). Another aunt of his Ashe Drubtob Zangmo (a she grub thob bzang mo, d.u.) was a consort of Tangtong Gyelpo<sub> <u>(thang stong rgyal po, 1361-1485).</u></sub>

Jikten Gonpo is said to have experienced a vision that compelled him to send his son Ziji Pel (gzi brjid dpal, d.u.) to the south, where the young man would establish a monastery. The prophecy was fulfilled when Ziji Pel founded the Chalkha Gonpa (chal kha dgon pa) in Paro (spa gro).
